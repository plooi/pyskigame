IS THERE ISSUE WITH DRAW LINE 3D LINE WIDTH???
use draw array for all graphics drawing

Drawing
    Option 1 (500 objects max, but easy)
        Just call draw_rect or draw_quad
    Option 2 (5000 objects max, but kinda difficult and only one type of draw option supported. Supports moving objects)
        Each step, create a new list with object depth order (or with arbitrary
        order if 3D) and then convert that list to numpy array, then add to 
        VertexHandler object and draw the vertex handler object
    Option 3 (500000 objects max, but also kinda difficult. No moving objects)
        Each step, update vertices in VertexHandler
        Then draw the VertexHandler
